## project 2 - data visualization

For this project, I used a dataset that shows the happiness index for countries or regions from 2016 through 2022.
Each circle's size is based on the country's rank and their colours based on their score.
When you click on a circle, the rank and score for that country is displayed at the bottom.
There is also a legend for making the colour a bit more clear.

After the critique, I tried making the circles sort with the sort function but I couldn't get it to work fully.
